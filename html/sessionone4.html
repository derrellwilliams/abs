					<h3>the musicians: session 4</h3>
						<p class="about">
Drew and I put the kids to bed one night and took a drive to Pegram, TN.  The small town outside of Nashville is home to Tim May and his music shop and studio Fiddle & Pick.  In this cool little building, Tim and his wife Gretchen host jams, teach lessons and create all sorts of music; we were honored to spend some time there.  We also felt very privileged to have Tim pick a little on some tunes with us.  Tim is one of Nashville’s most sought after flatpickers and was selected by the Nashville Scene in the Best Instrumentalist category in 2012.  Although Tim and Drew have jammed together often it was my first time meeting him; it didn’t take long to feel like old friends.  We laughed and jammed and we were delighted with the sound he added to the songs.  Find out more about him at <a href="www.timmaymusic.net"> www.timmaymusic.net</a>, and more about <a href="http://fiddleandpick.ning.com">Fiddle & Pick</a>.

							<h5>Hey Mama (Lacey Williams):</h5>
							<p class="songs">
							Drew likes to tell the story about coming home late one Friday night from a football game and walking in to hear me playing this song on the piano.  He says he listened quietly and instantly loved the song.  What he doesn’t share is that he took advantage of my concentration and burst in the room – scaring the *@%# out of me.  When I finally forgave him we worked up the song.  It’s a shout out to my mom and all those new moms (like me) who realize they have no clue what they are doing.							
							<h5>Wheel Hoss (Bill Monroe):</h5>
							<p class="songs">
							We knew we wanted to record a barnburner with Tim so we chose the old Bill Monroe song Wheel Hoss, though Drew’s iPhone autocorrected it to “Wheel House.” Tim kept us on our toes with his monster guitar playing (on the 6 string he built). We had a blast jamming this old time classic.</p>
