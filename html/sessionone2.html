					<h3>the musicians: session 2</h3>
						<p class="about">
When we say that we jam with our friends.  We mean our friends.  Like our call in the middle of the night, know where their medicine cabinet is kind of friends.  We met Tim Gates before even coming to Nashville and ended up moving in a block from their family without knowing it.  We are so glad we did.  Since then we’ve been following him on his journey with his band Due West and tagging along when we can.  In the meantime, our kids have grown up together and we take every chance we get to hear Tim sing.  I’m convinced that Tim could sing the fine print of a mortgage contract and anyone would pay attention.  This session was a blast to record and we hope you have as much fun listening as we did recording!</a><br><br>
							
							<div class="songtitle"><h3>The Songs: Session 2</h3></div>
							
							
							<h5>Disappear:</h5>
							<p class="songs">
							Tim called me one night with a song idea and we threw verses back and forth before getting together and finishing “Disappear”.  I loved the originality of the song and its sadness pulls at my heartstrings every time. </p> 
							
							<h5>Off Day:</h5>
							<p class="songs">
							When we mentioned doing a session with Tim, he instantly suggested this song that he wrote with fellow band mate Brad Hull.  The first time I heard it I knew that Tim had written it about his wife Roberta, who has come to his rescue with keys, glasses and wallet countless times.  Anyone who has had an off day or two can relate to this tune.</p>
							
							
							<h5>I Saw Three Ships</h5>
							<p class="songs">
							This English carol has long been a favorite of ours.  And considering the season we thought we’d put together a rendition of it.  We used whatever instrument we could grab and ended up with 2 fiddles, a five string violin, a mandolin and Drew’s homemade Cajon.  This turned out to be one of my favorite recordings we’ve done so far!  </p>
